        <h2 id="1-INTRODUCTION"><a href="#1-INTRODUCTION" class="headerlink" title="1. INTRODUCTION"></a>1. INTRODUCTION</h2><p>In traditional trading algorithms, researchers trade stocks based on their fundamental  and technical analysis, which is however very hard to generate excess earning in an  efficient market. Especially in today’s market with tons of new information changes,  alternative data and unstructured data are transforming the financial industry in crowdfunding, insurance, investment fields.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Alternative data, from unconventional sources or of unstructured nature, thus play an  increasingly important role in today’s investment strategies. Alternative data could be  data from different sources and with different categories, such as textual analysis,  image processing, digital footprints from social media and mobile devices, and  emerging data from the Internet of Things (Cong et al. 2019). Though alternative data  has already been a strong driving factor of stock price movement by some investors  (Jagtiani, J. and Lemieux, C., 2019), there are very few mature theories or models  describing how to develop investment strategies with alternative data factors.</p>
<p>Therefore, this paper uses alternative data as one of the most important factors that  could predict stocks and excess earning. By nature, stock price changes are driven by  people’s expectations of or confidence in the corresponding company. In order to learn  better people’s expectations, knowing how popular a particular stock is would be very  useful. Nowadays, search engines became a primary source where millions of people  could find answers to all the questions they have. Additionally, the search engine  provides the “truth” in zero moments in terms of finding and analyzing the information.  Therefore, we selected a particular alternative data source –Google search engine,  trying to find the popular information that stays behind the millions of everyday search  requests and to utilize it to help people to make investment decisions.</p>
<p>In this paper, I will reflect on the relationship between alternative data from search  engines and stock return first. Then, the alternative data should be added to the  traditional model to improve the predicting ability of the model we build.</p>
<h2 id="2-LITERATURE-REVIEW"><a href="#2-LITERATURE-REVIEW" class="headerlink" title="2. LITERATURE REVIEW"></a>2. LITERATURE REVIEW</h2><p>In early research, alternative data has been used in intrusion detection systems to  distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate activities (C. Warrender et. al.,1999). In  2011, Bollen, J. et.al. researched the relationship between sentiment indicators implied  by Twitter and the DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average). They extracted keywords  related to mood indicators from Twitter and processed these keywords into six factors:  Calm, Alert, Certainty, Enthusiasm, Kindness, Happy. Orbital insight (Mittal, P., 2020) predicted Wal-Mart’s sales by counting the number of cars in front of the store’s parking  lot and estimating global oil reserves by analyzing satellite images of oil refining plants  and storage sites using shadow areas. Green et al. (2019) used the data from  Glassdoor.com researching the relationship between the evaluation of stuff to  employers and stock yield in companies and stated that the change of the evaluating  score can predict the expected return of a stock. Da, Huang, and Jin (2021) used the  weekly score of retail investors on Forcerank App to study the negative correlation  between investors’ excessive extrapolation of beliefs and future stock returns. However,  due to data limitations, the sample of this article is only from 2016&#x2F;2 to 2017&#x2F;12,  involving less than 300 stocks and about 1,000 users. In this research, the author also  emphasizes the investors in the sample cannot represent all trades in these stocks. In  this paper, I will reflect on the relationship between alternative data from search  engines and stock return first. Then, the alternative data should be added to the  traditional model to improve the predicting ability of the model we build. Besides, I  would combine the alternative data with the traditional model to move forward with a  single step of predicting stock return.</p>
<h2 id="3-HYPOTHESIS-DEVELOPMENT"><a href="#3-HYPOTHESIS-DEVELOPMENT" class="headerlink" title="3. HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT"></a>3. HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT</h2><p>Alternative data could be used to guide the investment. First, compared with traditional  factors analysis based on historical transaction data, market data, etc, alternative data  could be acquired in more ways, with a larger amount of data and richer types  (Kolanovic, M. and Krishnamachari, R.T., 2017). Second, alternative data could reflect  potential information that is not existing in traditional data (Monk, A.H.B., et.al., 2018),  such as social concern degree, consumer evaluation, and other external factors. This  kind of information could be embedded in alternative data such as search trends (CHOI,  H. and VARIAN, H., 2012) and online chatting history. For these reasons, alternative  data could be collected, wrangled, and analyzed to guide the investment behavior,  obtaining the external market factors which cannot be obtained through traditional  analyzing methods.</p>
<p>Besides, the influence of alternative data is different in industries. Alternative data  could reflect potential factors compared with the traditional analyzing method. Different  industries have different sensitives to market (Pérez, A., et.al., 2020). For example, the  degree of social concern could impact emerging industries more, while the impact on  stable industries is less. This paper would analyze this through 11 industry  classifications of GISG.</p>
<p>Finally, applying alternative data and traditional data together to construct the  prediction model could get better results (Hasan, M., et.al., 2020). Alternative data  provides external market information compared to traditional data (Monk, A., et.al., 2019). This information could be added to get a more accurate picture of how the  market is currently functioning. As we all know, information is the cornerstone of  prediction. The more accurately the influencing factors are described, the more  accurate the prediction results will be. Therefore, the addition of alternative data can  help to improve the level of equity returns forecast.</p>
<h2 id="4-DATA"><a href="#4-DATA" class="headerlink" title="4. DATA"></a>4. DATA</h2><h3 id="4-1-Alternative-Data-Source"><a href="#4-1-Alternative-Data-Source" class="headerlink" title="4.1 Alternative Data Source"></a>4.1 Alternative Data Source</h3><p>We would use the Google Trends data as the inputs for our alternative data factor in  this paper, which reflects the concerning degree of specific terms from society. For  each topic about the components in the SP 500 index, we have weekly “interest over  time” data. Scale-up of the modified data using a method like Min-Max Standardized  to get the interest score, which represents the search interest relative to the highest  point on the chart in a given area and time. 100 is the most popular value. A value of  50 means the term has halved in popularity. A score of 0 means there is not enough  data for this term. These alternative data could be used to obtain the comprehensive  sentiment index to calculate the standardized alternative data and find the relationship  between the standardized alternative data factors and the returns of individual stocks.</p>
<h3 id="4-2-Data-Source-for-other-factors"><a href="#4-2-Data-Source-for-other-factors" class="headerlink" title="4.2 Data Source for other factors"></a>4.2 Data Source for other factors</h3><p>We could obtain the data for the market factor, size factor, and value factor from  Kenneth R. French - Data Library. Also, we can obtain the adjusted close price data  for the stocks of all the SP 500 components using Intrinio API. And then we can  calculate the weekly returns, to match the weekly popularity score obtained from  Google Trends.</p>
<h3 id="4-3-Data-Wrangling"><a href="#4-3-Data-Wrangling" class="headerlink" title="4.3 Data Wrangling"></a>4.3 Data Wrangling</h3><p>We can take several steps to clean the Google Trends data and to calculate a  “Popularity” indicator for each company as inputs for our alternative data factor: </p>
<ol>
<li>obtain the company name list of all the components in the SP 500 index. </li>
<li>use Google trends API to obtain the top 25 popular keywords1 for each company  (e.g. the top 25 keywords that are most frequently searched for Amazon include  Amazon Prime, Amazon Video, and Amazon Stock, etc.).</li>
<li>obtain the search count for each keyword(topic).</li>
<li>sum up the search counts of the 25 keywords for each company to get the  aggregated popularity score for each company. </li>
<li>use the popularity score as an alternative data factor, analyze its relationship with  daily stock prices.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="5-FACTOR-MODELING-WITH-ALTERNATIVE-DATA-FACTORS"><a href="#5-FACTOR-MODELING-WITH-ALTERNATIVE-DATA-FACTORS" class="headerlink" title="5. FACTOR MODELING WITH ALTERNATIVE DATA FACTORS"></a>5. FACTOR MODELING WITH ALTERNATIVE DATA FACTORS</h2><h3 id="5-1-One-factor-Model"><a href="#5-1-One-factor-Model" class="headerlink" title="5.1 One-factor Model"></a>5.1 One-factor Model</h3><p>First, we could build the simplest one-factor model to see the relationship between  stock returns and popularity score for a company, trying to see in which industry the  estimate of alternative data factor coefficient is most significant. For each industry in  GISC, the popularity score is taken as an independent variable and the positive and  negative of stock returns are taken as dependent variables to build a logistics  regression model (Julien, H., 2019). Compared with the regression model, the  classifier model could get better predictive accuracy in this model. Although logistic  regression could not reflect the accurate quantitative relationship between  independent variables and dependent variables, it could judge the correlation between  them according to the prediction accuracy. The regression model could choose the  SVM kernel model, neural network (Kangxian Y., 2018), etc. These methods have good  classification results for nonlinear problems. KNN, decision tree, and other  classification results are spatially regular shapes, which are not applicable to this case.  The model is evaluated by cross-validation on the dataset to ensure the stability of the  experiment results.</p>
<p>The model accuracy data obtained from the evaluation can reflect the different impacts  of alternative data factors on different industries. If the accuracy is close to 1, the  relationship between the two is very close. If the accuracy is close to 0.5 (as the  accuracy of purely random predictions is 0.5), the two are almost unrelated.</p>
<h3 id="5-2-Multi-Factor-Model"><a href="#5-2-Multi-Factor-Model" class="headerlink" title="5.2 Multi-Factor Model"></a>5.2 Multi-Factor Model</h3><p>Then, we could generate a comprehensive “popularity” factor using a list of keywords  related to our proposed companies as a main independent variable of the alternative  data. We collected all related keywords searched and using google trend statistics for  the past year. As a dependent variable, we used stock prices of all the components in  the SP 500 for the same time horizon. Then we could build a “popularity” regression  model with both traditional factors and alternative data factors. Also, establish a  regression model that only includes traditional factors. Here we choose the ElasticNet  regression method (De Mol, C., et.al. 2009). ElasticNet regression method performs  better when there are multiple independent variables and the independent variables  have a correlation. The two models were trained in the same way on the dataset, and  the prediction deviations of the two models were compared to carry out a performance  comparison. Then we could see whether adding alternative data can improve the  prediction performance.</p>
<h2 id="6-EXPECTED-RESULTS"><a href="#6-EXPECTED-RESULTS" class="headerlink" title="6. EXPECTED RESULTS"></a>6. EXPECTED RESULTS</h2><h3 id="6-1-Results-for-One-Factor-Model"><a href="#6-1-Results-for-One-Factor-Model" class="headerlink" title="6.1 Results for One-Factor Model"></a>6.1 Results for One-Factor Model</h3><p>In One-Factor Model, we could judge the impact of alternative data on different  industries according to the accuracy of the model in each industry. we expect to see in  some industries the stock returns are more sensitive to the alternative data factor, and  vice versa in other industries. In some specific industries, the stock returns fluctuate  more if people search more of the company and its related topics. But in some other  industries, the stock returns maintain relatively stable regardless of people’s interest  in the company.</p>
<h3 id="6-2-Results-for-Multi-Factor-Model"><a href="#6-2-Results-for-Multi-Factor-Model" class="headerlink" title="6.2 Results for Multi-Factor Model"></a>6.2 Results for Multi-Factor Model</h3><p>In our modified multi-factor Model, we take into consideration of both traditional factors  and alternative data factors. The result of this model would reflect whether alternative  data can improve the predictive ability of the model under the same condition of other  factors. We excepted its predictive power should become stronger if we use alternative  data as an additional factor. Plus, the more diverse the alternative data used, the  predictive power could be better.</p>
<h2 id="7-CRITICAL-DISCUSSION"><a href="#7-CRITICAL-DISCUSSION" class="headerlink" title="7. CRITICAL DISCUSSION"></a>7. CRITICAL DISCUSSION</h2><p>First, the wise investment decision should base on alternative data we collected, which  means alternative data factor correlation with the investment decision closely.  Therefore, if the data from websites is unbiased is a factor that should be emphasized,  the alternative data would produce errors due to the errors of the selected websites  and data sources themselves.</p>
<p>Second, the data would be biased in the production process. The data from different  sources could produce different results (Amenc, N., et.al., 2003). Therefore, reliability  analysis of alternative data needs to be emphasized, and cross-validation with data  from different sources should be considered. </p>
<p>Besides, alternative data in this paper may combine seemingly related factors without  actually explaining the underlying logic of events, and would require the linkage of  quantitative and macro analyses, with quantitative and qualitative analyses  complementing each other.</p>
<p>In addition, alternative data from a wide range of sources will cause the problem that  data is not representative, and the more alternative data selected, the worse the  prediction ability will be. Therefore, when selecting data, we should analyze logically  whether the alternative data is rational and helpful for investment, rather than choosing  all data as independent variables at once.</p>
<p>Last, the stability of alternative data is also a major factor affecting its use. Data format  changes, API revisions, and even data source changes could lead to the unsustainable  use of alternative data. Fortunately, many data providers have realized the importance  and commercial value of data and started to establish relevant data service platforms  (Belissent, J., 2017). This facilitates future studies on alternative data.</p>
<h2 id="8-CONCLUSIONS"><a href="#8-CONCLUSIONS" class="headerlink" title="8. CONCLUSIONS"></a>8. CONCLUSIONS</h2><p>In this report, we developed a factor modeling investment strategy to source good  deals to invest in. Based on our strategy, we suggest using alternative data and  people’s interests to assist investment decision making. The results of the One-factor  reflect the impact of alternative data in different industries. The Multi-Factor regression  model shows that alternative could improve the predictive power. Although there are  still some issues in the acquisition path and stability of alternative data, its application  in improving the accuracy of predicting stock returns deserves attention.</p>
